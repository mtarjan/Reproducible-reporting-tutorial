# Reproducible-reporting-tutorial
Example code for a reproducible report from data in central Biotics

First run the Query-Biotics code to obtain the csv of data that are visualized in the document. Alternatively, if you do not have a connection to Biotics set up (you need Whitney's help for this), obtain the csv file from Max and put it in a folder called "data" in the project's directory. Then knit the Reproducible-report.Rmd file.
